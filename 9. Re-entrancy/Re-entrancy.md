## 9. Re-entrancy

First, deploy the ReentrancyExploit contract with 1 ether. It will donate 1 ether from the contract to the victim contract.
Then, call the **pwn()** function.

```javascript
web3.eth.sendTransaction({
    to:attacker,
    from:player,
    data: web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature('pwn()')
})
```

This function will call the victim's **withdraw()** function, claiming 1 ether.\
When the victim will send 1 ether to our attacker contract, with the *call* function, it will fall into the attacker's fallback function, and re-enter the victim contract.\
At this moment, the victim contract won't have changed its state, and the attacker contract will be able to bypass the balance verification.

The attacker contract will be able to withdraw all the ether of the contract. After that, we can call the attacker's **withdraw()** function to get the ether.

```javascript
web3.eth.sendTransaction({
    to:attacker,
    from:player,
    data: web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature('withdraw()')
})
```
