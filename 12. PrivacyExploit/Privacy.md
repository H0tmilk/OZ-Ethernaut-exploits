## 12. Privacy

We can decompile the contract which has deployed the Privacy contract : https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/bytecode-decompiler?a=0x11343d543778213221516d004ed82c45c3c8788b \
This way, we can see how the contract is deploying Privacy, and which parameters are given to the constructor :

```log
create contract with 0 wei
code: 0xfe6080..., sha3(tx.origin, '0'), sha3(tx.origin, '1'), sha3(tx.origin, '2')
```

We have 3 bytes32 sha3 hash, which are filling the bytes[3] array of the Privacy contract.\
As we can see in the **unlock(bytes16)** function, the key is data[2] in bytes16 format.

We can use the PrivacyExploit contract to easily unlock the Privacy contract.

```javascript
web3.eth.sendTransaction({
    to:attacker,
    from:player,
    data: web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature('pwn()')
})
```
